Reflection:

1. A safe empty state where you set the values of the data members to 0, null, or to
a null terminator. A safe empty state is used to hard code a value to the data members
so no extra value, data, or memory will be leaked into the data members. Another 
safe empty state could be setting each data member to null. The reason, null could be described
as a black hole terminating each value in the variable before hand. 

2. You can minimized code duplication in this workshop by using the function called, 
isEmpty(), instead of checking to see if the values of the data members are empty or
null each function. Another way of minimizing code duplication is by putting each if 
statement on one way to check to see if each condition is met. The last thing you could do
is to create a function called safeEmptyState() to preset the data members. 

3. The reason why we can access the private data members in the function canTravelWith()
because this function is a member function in the Passenger class. This member function
can also access the other Passenger object because of how this parameter was passed 
through the function in the main.

4. The statement you would need to add to ensure that the function strncpy() works 
properly is the destination (where is the data going), source (what is the data) and the 
size. Size is important because it checks to see if the destination is within the range
of the source. 

5. The thing that I have learned in this workshop is to understand more about member functions
and constructors. The information I learned about from constructors is that they can be used
to validate, call other functions, or even set/copy data to a data member.

	quanity += num;
	return *this;
